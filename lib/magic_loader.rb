module MagicLoader
  # A wonderfully simple way to load your code.
  #
  # The easiest way to use require_all is to just point it at a directory
  # containing a bunch of .rb files.  These files can be nested under 
  # subdirectories as well:
  #
  #  MagicLoader.require_all 'lib'
  #
  # This will find all the .rb files under the lib directory and load them.
  # The proper order to load them in will be determined automatically.
  #
  # If the dependencies between the matched files are unresolvable, it will 
  # throw the first unresolvable NameError.
  #
  # You can also give it a glob, which will enumerate all the matching files: 
  #
  #  MagicLoader.require_all 'lib/**/*.rb'
  #
  # It will also accept an array of files:
  # 
  #  MagicLoader.require_all Dir.glob("blah/**/*.rb").reject { |f| stupid_file(f) }
  # 
  # Or if you want, just list the files directly as arguments:
  #
  #  MagicLoader.require_all 'lib/a.rb', 'lib/b.rb', 'lib/c.rb', 'lib/d.rb'
  #
  def self.require_all(*args)
    # Handle passing an array as an argument
    args.flatten!
    
    if args.size > 1
      # Expand files below directories
      files = args.map do |path|
        if File.directory? path
          Dir[File.join(path, '**', '*.rb')]
        else
          path

          files = [arg]
